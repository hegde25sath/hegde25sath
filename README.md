### Hi

I'm Sathvik, and I'm a computer science sophomore @ Purdue. My focus is in [computational science and engineering](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/track-cse-fall2023.html), and supporting that is my mathematics minor. 

Languages that I am proficient in, in descending order of fluency, are:
  - Java, C, x86-64, Python

Feel free to contact me through my LinkedIn.
